# Minimum Distance between location

## Description

The objective is to minimize the total travel distance while ensuring that all delivery points are visited. 
Implement a solution that finds the shortest possible route that visits each delivery point exactly once and returns to the starting point (i.e., solve the Travelling Salesman Problem).

Requirements:
Input: A list of delivery points, each represented by a pair of coordinates (x, y).
Output: The shortest possible route (as a list of delivery points) and the total travel distance.
